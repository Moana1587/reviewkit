Comment: First time getting our windows cleaned, Lewis gives a fantastic and professional experience throughout. He is very knowledgeable, makes sure we understood exactly what work he was carrying out and how he can help us in the long run. Fully kitted out with a professional looking van and equipment you cannot go wrong. Would highly recommend!

Comment: Really great service! Caught Lewis on the off chance whilst passing by as he was cleaning the neighbours windows. Very approachable, friendly and booked to our convenience. Great price! Definitely will continue with the service. Windows are what they should be sparkly clean despite a 6’fence being in the way.

Comment: If you are looking for a window cleaner in Kent, please do not look any further that Pure Water Window Cleaning. We had our gutters, fascias and windows cleaned this morning and we are amazed with the results. Lewis provides a professional and friendly service. Highly Recommend *****

Comment: Lewis was recommended to me and I'm glad he was! I'd always struggled to find a reliable window cleaner that actually did a good job but Lewis did just that. I went with everything. Windows, fascias and even my driveway and all were gleaming afterwards! And it was even a good price too!

Comment: I have had drives cleaned 3 times in the past at other properties I have owned. Nothing like this! Lewis used a wire brush to scrape between every joint, then the round spinny thing , then the pressure washer. The drive he cleaned is 14 years old and is adjacent to a new are we have just laid. There is barely any difference now. Incredible job!

Comment: Such a professional and friendly service. I went from a company that I wasn’t overly happy with to finding Lewis who I will not now use anyone else. He went above and beyond, was friendly and did an amazing job. I couldn’t be happier thank you very much
