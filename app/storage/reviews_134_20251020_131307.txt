Comment: (Translated by Google) 8/5 stars. Definitely join in. Tommy Terror was fantastic and made the tour a real experience. The old bus alone created a great atmosphere.

8/5 Sternen. Unbedingt mitmachen. Tommy Terror war großartig und hat die Tour zum Erlebnis gemacht. Allein der alte Bus hat schon für Stimmung gesorgt.

Comment: We had so much fun on this ghost bus tour! Tommy Terror was awesome and funny, a masterful storyteller. Family friendly jokes and atmosphere. Not actually scary at all… But it is packed with excellent history about real serial killers, murderers, executed thieves, and the local hauntings surrounding them. You have the option to get off the bus and stand in Edinburgh’s oldest graveyard and try to capture a picture of a spirit in the haunted guard tower. What better way to spend an hour?

(Definitely get there at least 15 minutes early to get in line, as seating is first-come-first-serve. Our tour was sold out. My bf and I were 17 minutes early and we got the last empty 2-seat bench. A couple right after us had to ask a single rider to move and sit with another single rider so they could sit together. And one couple arrived 5 minutes before the start of the tour, got on the bus, realized they wouldn’t be able to sit together, and decided to get off and ask for a refund. If you care where you sit, be early.)

Comment: It was cute, they clearly make an effort, what with the videos, makeup, interacting with everyone, etc. Getting out of the bus was a good idea to break it up and stretch your legs. Tommy terror was sweet. The granny stuff was a bit much, but the stories they shared were really interesting and gave us a different view of the wonderful city.

Comment: We were really entertained and convinced by the ghost tour bus. It offers a good possibility to see Edinburghs most important spots, while learning something about its darkest backgrounds ????. Would recommend taking the 9pm-Timeslot, to make the ride feel a bit more creepy.

Comment: Arrived at 8:09pm for the 9pm tour. The queue gradually built up. The tour operator (red branded jacket on) decided the front of the queue would be at the end, meaning everyone who turned up early was last on and those turning up just before were first on. When several groups told him he just said “I don’t know who arrived first” even though many of us were telling him so. The your advised to turn up early as it’s first come first served - this is not the case.

Once on the bus it was very crowded and hot. The tour guide started his opening speech and then stopped part way through his introduction, breaking character, to let late comers on who smelt heavily of alcohol as they walked through the crowded bus to find the last two spare seats.

The windows were very dirty so couldn’t really see out of them very well for pictures or observation. A couple of times the bus stopped at places where there was either not much to be seen or the view was obscured by road signs.

The tour guide/actor was enthusiastic, as was the driver and this feedback/criticism is not aimed at them. The content and production was very poor though - lots of silly jokes, sound effects and videos and a made up ghost story about the bus. Honestly, I found the tour boring and disappointing especially for one of the most haunted cities in the UK.

The tour was 55 minutes long, not 75 minutes, and did not represent good value for money or time. We saved this for our last night in Edinburgh but I feel we could have better spent the time elsewhere unfortunately. Went back to our accommodation feeling flat after what had been a lovely day and week.

There’s definitely potential for this to be a great tour but better content and production needed.

Comment: I’m not sure what I was expecting but surely this wasn’t it. They told some darker stories of Edinburgh but I genuinely thought there was gonna be more to it, something moving inside the bus or someone touching us; something really scary but…. Nothing. Just weak jokes and bad “special” effects. Confusing and overpriced

Comment: This was such a fun and unique thing to do in the city! We bought tickets on a whim after a few drinks at the pub and had no trouble walking to the pickup location. The tour itself was entertaining and easy to follow. Adi was absolutely hilarious, super engaging, and clearly a talented actor—he really made the experience. Great mix of laughs and storytelling, definitely worth it!

Comment: Definitely a nice tour with a spooky touch for everyone who’d like to get to know more about the “dark side” of Edinburgh. Our guide Tommy Terror -and of course our driver Angus- were great and entertaining. I can recommend it to everyone who has an hour to kill and wants some comedic-spookiness. Butttt it’s nothing truly mind-blowing or an absolute “must-do”. Still! It’s lovely, fun and entertaining.

Comment: I dragged my friends to this. They were a bit reluctant, but I've taken the London Ghost Bus Tour and knew how fun they were. Lots of interesting history about Edinburgh while driving around as well as some fun scares with the driver. Love all the puns as well! My friends ended up loving it along with me.

Comment: We did a ghost bus tour this weekend. We took our kids (6,9 and 11) as well as granny. Everyone enjoyed the trip, the kids found it entertaining and a little jumpy in places (which they enjoyed). I wasn't sure what to expect but everyone in our group had a good experience. The guide was excellent and very aware of the kids on the trip.

Comment: Myself and 2 kids.  Ages 7 and 10 did the 6pm one.   Tommy terror is fantastic his knowledge is brilliant but delivers stories with a bit of fun too.    Eve loves the story about granny and throwing poop out the window.    We loved every minute.   Was nice to hear a lot of history and see a wee bit more of Edinburgh.   Just wish it could have been a big longer than an hour as we were really enjoying. Ourselves.

Comment: Uncomfortable Guide. Awful attitude/nasty to kids. Tour disappointing. Muttered "I'm n...

Last, late trip on Thursday, 10 July 2025.
See someone else has commented & the photo she has posted on Trip Advisor alongside her post is the back of me & so know she's deffo on the same trip. Tour guide said his name was lan. Very intolerant of anyone nervously speaking or laughing when he was talking. It's a ghost tour after all. There's a nicer, kinder & professional way of asking - with good humour - for people to pay attention.

He kept threatening to throw everyone off the bus. A lovely group of students celebrating as just graduated got off mid-tour plus a family.

Because disgusted by his comments. IMO.
Seems an unhappy man. Racist, horrid to the kids on board, with no patience & seemed just reeling off the spiel sounding bored & unenthusiastic.

Muttered, “I'm not paid enough for this nonsense", as he passed me by. In general, tour was a bit naff. Just a small screen with images that were difficult to see & the commentator speaking so fast it was hard to keep up. A few flickering lights & some loud bang noises for the scary effect but not convincing. Cost us a lot for our group of teens. A big disappointment. Cannot recommend.

Comment: (Translated by Google) I recommend it for families, especially with children between 8 and 12 years old: the guide is excellent and will give them that touch of fright. For older children, don't expect to experience the jump scare of your life... Enjoy these tales and legends of the city of Edinburgh.
The bus is great: an old Adams family-style jalopy.

(Original)
Je recommande en famille, surtout avec des enfants entre 8 et 12 ans : le guide est excellent et il saura leur procurer ce soupçon de frayeur. Pour les grands, ne vous attendez pas à vivre le jump scared de votre vie... Profitez de ces comtes et légendes de la ville d'Edimburg.
Le bus est génial : un vieux tacot genre famille Adams.

Comment: The bus picked us up and then Tommy Terror took us for a tour around town, blending stories with jokes. It was one of the highlights of our trip to Edinburgh. Also helped to have visited Surgeons' Hall Museum for example, where information about gravesnatching came in handy as a complement to Tommy's descriptive details.

Comment: Avoid this tour. We booked for six people, showed up on time, and were told they were overbooked — again — and that we’d need to contact Viator for a refund. No accountability, just a casual “this happens every day.”

They admitted overbooking is their normal practice, which is absurd. Why keep selling tickets you can’t honor? It’s a blatant disregard for customers’ time and money. Several other groups were turned away too.

Plenty of other ghost tours in Edinburgh actually respect their guests. This one is a disorganized mess. Steer clear.

Comment: We had an awesome time during this tour. The bus tour offers another view of the city and permits to go farther and faster than a walking tour. Our guide was very entertaining and fun. It was like being a part of the show. Every second was filled with another story. There was also a little break (again filled with ghost stories) where we could take pictures from a beautiful viewpoint of the Edinburgh castle.

Comment: (Translated by Google) My partner and I booked this activity during our trip to Edinburgh. We had Tommy Terror as our guide and it was worth it! A subtle blend of humor and scary stories. I recommend it wholeheartedly. For those who are unsure, my partner isn't very comfortable with the Scottish accent, but he understood everything because Tommy's delivery was so perfect! I recommend it, I recommend it, I recommend it!

Nous avons réservé cette activité avec mon compagnon lors de notre voyage à Edinbourgh. Nous avons eu Tommy Terror en accompagnateur et ça en valait la peine ! Un subtil mélange d’humour et d’histoires effrayantes. Je recommande les yeux fermés. Pour les dubitatifs, mon compagnon n’est pas hyper à l’aise avec l’accent écossais, il a tout compris tant l’élocution de Tommy était parfaite ! Je recommande, je recommande, je recommande !

Comment: The bus tour was so much fun, the tour guide was so fun and cute. The walk through the graveyard at night was lovely. The stories about the ghost history of Edinburgh were so interesting, and it was a fun way to learn about them. It's definitely worth the money, and if you visit Edinburgh, it should definitely be on your list. Definitely recommend 10/10

Comment: The Ghost Bus picks you up from a local area. The bus was full when we went for Friday tour at 6pm. The MC Tommy was super enthusiastic and entertaining, he made sure to go to both upstairs and downstairs of the bus which was super. We got to see areas that were important to the locals as well as hear cool stories. The only downside, I wish we got to see a little more for the price for 1 hour drive around.

Comment: After the ghost bus tour in London, we had plans already made for the first night in Edinburgh. This ghost bus tour was such a great time as expected!

We planned an early evening show so the sun was setting during the tour and by the very end it was night. Loved all of the ghost stories and seeing great places that we later visited on our own time.

Tommy was our amazing guide, very funny and charismatic. Even took the time to take photos with everyone after the show which I thought was very sweet!

Comment: I booked a tour with The Ghost Bus on the 14th of March for  the 7.30 pm show for a work outing.  Our group had a fabulous time and our conductor was so funny and knowledgeable.  He really made the night.  We would highly recommend this tour, it was great fun listening to the gory tales of old Edinburgh.  Thank you so much for a wonderful night!

Comment: I was on the tour with my partner at the weekend it was OK although front TV stopped working and foreigners on the bus kept talking and acting up so alot of the time I couldn't hear the host talking.. although he did try to get them to shut up but they still didn't. I reckon it would of been a good experience if it weren't for that I may try again.

Avery balanced combination of bad puns, few jumpscares to be expected that nonetheless still make you jump a bit, in depth explanations about Edinburgh's stories and ghosts, and a small trip or stop at the cemetery overall make for a good experience. Shout out to the host Tommy Terror, that lad is wonderful.

Comment: (Translated by Google) It's an experience worth going to. They tell Edinburgh's ghost stories in a fun way. You ride a bus past the actual locations of the ghost stories and listen to the stories. I got off at the graveyard and listened to the story of the body robbers, which was incredibly entertaining. They spoke in English, but thanks to instant translation apps these days, the language barrier wasn't too much of a problem. I saw other foreigners using the instant translation feature, so I copied them. It's not recommended for very young children. The stories can be difficult and scary.

Comment: I should have researched this in more depth before booking. More comedy than ghost bus tour! Tour was to last 75 mins but finished one hour on the dot.  Stop at the castle where everyone left the bus  to take photos ( a few more stories ).  This tour was just not for me. Disappointed

Comment: Interesting historical stories of the macabre history in Edinburgh all while riding a creepy old bus. The spooktologist Tommy Terror was super fun to listen to, my 9 year old son loved it! It is winter so it was pretty cold on the bus. Friendly people and we really enjoyed ourselves. They pick you up just down the way from the Frankenstein Pub. It was a great way to spend the evening in Edinburgh!

The bus was beautifully decorated, and the tour itself was fun, informative, and entertaining.
We had a great time.

Comment: Thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Thoroughly hilarious. I was also afforded the opportunity to see parts of Edinburgh that I might have otherwise missed. Excellent value for money. The only area of improvement, and it does not relate to the function of the tour, would be to give the website a slight refresh when it comes to making payment.

Comment: Great laugh. The host is excellent at what he does, full of knowledge, spot on humour, not even remotely cringey - all of it is just really good fun. I recommend walking 1 minute along the road afterward for a pint in Frankenstein bar to keep the spooky vibes going. ????

Comment: (Translated by Google) Avoid this. This isn't a horror bus.
It's just a compilation of made-up stories, the few "special effects" are ridiculous beyond words, and the acting leaves something to be desired. We didn't even make a stop at the cemetery as normally planned.
The tour lasted 50 minutes instead of 1 hour and 15 minutes!
The actor has the nerve to ask for tips at the end.
If you want to lose €21 per person, you've come to the right place.

(Original)
À fuir. Ça n'a rien d'un bus d'horreur.
Ça n'est qu'une compilation d'histoires inventées, le peu "d'effets spéciaux" est d'un ridicule sans nom et le jeu d'acteur laisse à désirer. Nous n'avons même pas fait d'arrêt au cimetière comme ce qui est normalement prévu.
Le tour a duré 50min au lieu de 1h15 !
L'acteur a le culot de demander des tips à la fin.
Si vous voulez perdre 21€/personne, vous êtes au bon endroit.

Comment: Very cool bus tour with great entertainment from the driver and Tommy Terror. We had a lot of fun on the tour and found the stories very exciting. If you were sitting close to the driver (at the front of the bus) it was sometimes difficult to understand the commentary as the bus was very loud.

Comment: Honestly if the target audience is 13 and below, it makes sense. The actor did a great job and put his energy into the ghost stories and skits, but overall for the adults it wasn’t “scary” or engaging. I expected to get off at more locations and hear more of the morbid history of the city, not just some made up ghost scares. Beware that this is more of a childrens’ entertainment venue than a dark history tour of the city.

Comment: A brilliant experience for tourists to take in some of the history and sights of Edinburgh! Our driver and conductor were funny and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It's definitely more of a light-hearted tour, so I would recommend another tour company if you want a serious tour, but we definitely learned some new stories!

Comment: Terrible experience as we were asked to leave the tour due to overbooking. We started queuing for the bus before the start time but found that there were no seats left after boarding. Extremely upset by the poor management, especially given that it is an established company in 3 cities with so many tours in a day. Not only was it a disappointment as we were looking forward to it, it was also a waste of our time. Furthermore, we were rudely asked by the conductor to get off the bus and he promptly drove off after leaving us on the sidewalk with the coordinator. To quote, his exact words were “get off, i don’t have time for this”, as if it was our fault for the overbooked bus. The management offered a full refund but given the time wasted, getting disappointed and being poorly treated, I don’t think that is sufficient. It was also our last day in Edinburgh so booking another slot on another day would not be impossible. Overall, I do not recommend booking this tour if you’re looking for a relaxing good time.

You’ll go off the bus once and than stay in the bus but the people in the bus are always included in the stories the guide is telling! There was also a kid behind us and it seemed not terrified for life afterwards ???????????????really worth to join this tour! Highly recommend!

Comment: It was OK. You learnt a lot about Edinburgh's horror stories (murders, etc.), but the scare factor was maybe a 2/10. I would have liked more jump scares or some props falling from above. The cemetery and the smoke at the end were the highlights. But for the money, I don't know. Also, right at the beginning (not the actor) there was someone I assume who wanted to get other people on the bus quickly, even though we all paid the same price. Is there an upgrade in the prices that we weren't told about? In any case, I found the behaviour very childish, as if some of the tourists were second class, and until we showed our booked tickets (because we told him, that we also booked tickets online) we were just let in. I expect more professionalism from the team.

You get onto an old bus to be talked at for 90minutes with some occasional screaming .

They made one stop at the st Cuthbert’s cemetery which was vaguely interesting.

The rest was a yawn!

Comment: Funny, knowledgeable and entertaining. It was an absolute joy to go on this tour. The driver and Tommy Terror, we got off the bus for 10 minutes or so, but if you didn’t want to, you could stay on the bus in a graveyard. Very fantastic enjoyable evening suitable for all the family

Comment: This is definitely for kids. Went with my mom when visiting edinburgh learnt afew things but not anything interesting enough to have done the tour. Don’t recommend if you are just adults going. The guide was great he’s been doing this a long time, just seems like the company who runs them could do a full makeover of the tour.

Comment: Might be worth it if you're under the age of 8!

The Actor did his best.... We did hear a few interesting things about Edinburgh...

Small old LCD TVs, which are hard to see, showing the actor talking into a mic. Sometimes will show parts of the inside bus with bad early 2000s effects. A rat running across the floor, a Witches face flashing on the screen etc

Asked to close the curtains at one point and they flashed the lamps on the tables ????

One stop where we got out, stood beside a car park and the Actor talked about the castle. Some of the children looked a little interested

Comment: I would give 0 stars if I could. We prebooked a tour & despite having contact details chose not to advise us that they couldn't be bothered to run the tour. £20 wasted in taxi fares to get to the pick up.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE APPARENTLY TOTALLY UNRELIABLE & WITHOUT BASIC CUSTOMER CARE SKILLS

Comment: Due to unexplained reasons the second floor of the bus could not be used, greatly limiting our view of the city.

But worse than that, the tour was cut short from 75 to 35 minutes - without any explanation whatsoever as to why the tour was cut short.

On top of that, the presentor's act was full of mistakes and it was clearly noticeable the actor had great difficulty adapting the act to the shortened performance.

Mistakes/issues happen, but this simply felt like the organization thinks it is OK to take people's money without providing any explanation, nor compensation. Plainly said, we were deceived!

Now I have to wait up to 5 days for a refund

Comment: Super fun tour for those who want to explore Edinburgh with a spin. We travelled with some family members with mobility issues, there are some stairs onto the bus so this is NOT for anyone fully disabled. Our party rode up top for the double-decker bus experience but beware the steps from the second floor are very steep. It’s an old bus and a very cool vibe, plus the tour has some cool “histories” of Edinburgh you wouldn’t get elsewhere. If you’re looking for a break from walking around, this is a fun time.

PS. As of right now, due to construction their pickup location has moved so be sure to check your email for communications before the tour!

Comment: Complete bust of a tour. Booked through Viator and the meeting location they give you is not the correct meeting spot. Asked the lady in the tourist information center where the guide is and she tells us they picked up from a spot around the corner. Ran to the bus and made it in time but were turned away and told we couldn’t enter.

The person handed us a pamphlet and said good luck getting your money back because they’re a bad company. There are plenty of other tours to do instead of this one.

Comment: This tour was a fun treat. Short, entertaining, and the bus itself was very cool. There’s one stop to get off and get some pictures, and the rest is a nice rest from walking around the city.

the only downside is that I went during the summer, where it doesn’t get dark until around 10, which is when the last tour ends. Perhaps it’s better (or scarier) in the spring, fall, or winter months when the sun actually sets at a decent time.

Our presenter was not only knowledgeable about the haunted history of the city, but also incredibly funny and charismatic. His storytelling had us on the edge of our seats one moment and laughing out loud the next. The atmosphere on the bus was electric, with just the right amount of spooky ambiance. Whether you're a skeptic or a true believer, this tour is a must-do for a thrilling night out! Highly recommend! ????????

Comment: Great tour, really fun and fantastic sorry telling by the guide. Also huge acknowledgment to the guy who was fielding tickets today and had to deal with a physically and verbally abusive hen party. Of which one particular member was highly unpleasant and perhaps missing a few brain cells. They clearly didn’t read the website about no hen parties and rocked up yelling and pushing the ticket guy making the tour late to leave as well. The ticket guy kept SO SO calm and dealt with all the fuss. I hope he doesn’t get any stick from any complaints this idiotic group make.

Comment: (Translated by Google) The tour guy was amazing, wonderful acting.

But unfortunately, it is not tourist friendly. There is no translation into different languages. My mom didn’t understand anything, and when I tried to explain it to her in small words, visitors were so rude, telling us to shut up. I do not recommend it for Arabs. There is no translation, and the trip is full of stories. Talking is prohibited.

Comment: 10000% recommend this tour.
Full of laughs, historic information, and a cemetery visit!!!
The conductor was just brilliant, with his knowledge and humour during the tour.
A little over an hour tour , you are driven around on an old haunted bus. The bus driver may or may not have been a ghost -
Driven through Old Edinburgh and new * 200 yrs old*  you are told of ghostly sightings and haunting. The cemetery is fantastic, and you are given a snippet of a few hauntings there, too, and an opportunity to do some ghost photos at the watch tower.
Soft adults or kids won't like it-  so just remember it's a ghost tour, and it's spooky!

Comment: (Translated by Google) Well, what should I write in capital letters? Aside from the fact that my English isn't the yellow from the EG ????????????, I found this tour very entertaining. There were some great effects during the bus ride, like smoke and flickering lights. So if you come to Edinburgh, you should definitely go on it.

(Original)
Ja was soll ich groß schreiben. Abgesehen davon das mein Englisch not the yellow from the EG ist ???????????? fand ich diese Tour sehr unterhaltsam. Tolle Effekte während der Busfahrt z.B Rauch oder auch flackernde lichter. Also wenn man nach edinburgh kommt sollte man sie auf jeden Fall mitmachen.

Comment: Fantastic family fun! Very entertaining and well executed entertainment on a spooky converted double decker bus. My 11yr old daughter loved it and said it was the best part of her visit to Edinburgh! As just my daughter and I travelling I didn't want to go on a walking tour and thought it safer to book the bus and be driven around the spooky sites of interest. Tommy Terror was absolutely amazing and although he must have the same script for each tour he literally was so enthusiastic and witty! We also think we got q spooky picture of the watch tower which I'll post ..zoom in on bottom right window !

Comment: Had booked the 7:30pm tour on a Thursday Night and wasn't expecting it to be busy but the bus was fully booked which we were glad about. Gave it a really good atmosphere. The conductor is very funny and had a good laugh. Also managed to scare a few of the children that were onboard successfully ????
Would definitely recommend and made it spookier that it was dark outside too so go for later bookings!

Comment: Absolutely brilliant, what a fun way to learn about the darker side of Edinburgh's history, the tour takes you around the city in an old route master bus decorated inside with a ghostly feel. The tour guide has us in stitches whill informing us of the history of the city and taking us on a tour of the graveyard at St Giles and telling us about some of the spooky sightings that have been seen, highly recommended if you enjoy the paranormal and a good laugh at the same time.

Comment: WOW! What an amazing ghost bus tour.

Our fantastic host had us on the edge of our seats, he was funny, informative, creative and even managed to keep in character and composed through that nasty witch Granny Black messing with his set and causing some malfunctions with the busses wiring!

Ten out of ten would recommend. Especially if you want to learn more about the real ghosts that walk the Edinburgh streets.

Comment: Taking this tour certainly made my trip to Edinburgh even more marvellous! Despite asking last-minute if there were any seats available, the driver enabled me to board the bus and found a seat for me! Our trip guide was also such a brilliant actor and had so much enthusiasm!
This tour is a MUST for all children and adults alike visiting Edinburgh! Can’t wait to do it again when I re-visit Edinburgh someday!

Comment: (Translated by Google) Still decided to post a review because we really disagree with the rave reviews. You pay almost 20 pounds per person. The actor is really dedicated and funny, but otherwise it's all very cheap. Ghost stories are short and superficial and everything is suggestion (except for the actor raising his voice every now and then, nothing exciting happens). 1 or 2 extra actors could make this much more fun. All in all: disappointing despite mega enthusiasm from the actor. Took an hour instead of 75 minutes btw.

(Original)
Toch besloten maar een review te plaatsen omdat we het echt niet eens zijn met de lovende recensies. Je betaalt bijna 20 pond pp. De acteur is ècht toegewijd en grappig maar verder is het allemaal erg goedkoop. Spookverhalen zijn kort en oppervlakkig en alles is suggestie (behalve dat acteur af en toe zijn stem verheft gebeurt er niks spannends). 1 of 2 extra acteurs zouden dit veel leuker kunnen maken. All in all: teleurstellend ondanks mega enthousiasme van acteur. Duurde een uur ipv 75 min btw.

Comment: A must do experience! Having read some of the 1 star reviews, I’m really surprised to hear others had a bad time. If you’re expecting a silly, non-sensible and entertaining time then look no further! If you’re after some gory and 18+, this isn’t for you. I’d suggest also doing one of the ghost walking tours as they have time to offer a little more background but thank for a great evening!

Comment: (Translated by Google) A fun adventure, but the volume is way too high on the bus.
The speakers are placed right next to your ears, which somewhat spoils the story told by the actor (who is actually quite funny). Luckily, my friend had earplugs with her, which allowed us to enjoy the tour a little more.
The part where you get off the bus and walk through a cemetery was very nice.
A bit pricey, though.

(Original)
Aventure sympathique mais le volume est beaucoup trop élevé dans le bus.
Les hauts parleur sont placés à côté des oreilles et gâche un peu l'histoire raconté par l'acteur (qui est d'ailleurs plutôt marrant). Heureusement que mon amie avait des boule quiess sur elle ce qui nous a permit d'apprécier un peu plus la visite.
La partie où l'on descend du bus pour passer à travers un cimetière était très sympa.
Un peu cher cela dit..

Comment: (Translated by Google) A cool tourist attraction including a cemetery tour, a sightseeing tour, and special effects. The showmen and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended.

Comment: Tour is terrible . Unsafe and just  all around bad . Pre Booked  guest are passed aside for passengers  that just randomly turn Up  the staff are rude and offer no solutions  to the dangerous seating arrangement. my partner had to sit on my lap because of the over booking  . The most horrific part of the tour is the comedy
Also they are thiefs

Comment: The tour was good, we'd been on the vaults tour earlier in the day and a lot of the information was the same as what you got on that so was a little disappointing, but other than that was worth the money.

Comment: Very honest review, this bus tour is not worth the money. It is boring and the only spooky thing about it is that you have to be trapped on it for an hour.  You get to come off the bus to walk through  a tiny cemetery whilst the guide tells you to look between the bushes for ghosts. Upon closer inspection there is nothing between the bushes . Perhaps we were meant to smoke something before this tour.
Also we were a group of 4 and we couldn't sit together and I had to sit in my partner's lap because the bus was full. We were notified to arrive when the bus departs so 9pm for us  but the ticket inspector said people queued up for half an hour to get on the bus.  We would have done the same but honestly still not worth the money.

Comment: Super fun and funny experience!  The tour guide was hilarious and though the ghost tour part was a little lacking (discussions as we passed by) it was still a lot of fun.  The only stop we made was a brief cemetery tour, which was awesome at night.  We've taken lots of ghost tours in various places in the US and UK, and though this was probably the least factual and frightening, I'd have to say it was the most fun and entertaining!

Comment: (Translated by Google) Worth every penny! A wonderful show with a slight creepiness and wonderfully dark humor. Highly recommended. There are no best seats, but I would recommend sitting right at the front, so you can also use the tour as a bit of sightseeing.

(Original)
Jeden Cent wert! Wunderbare Show mit leichten Gruselfaktor und wunderbar schwarzer Humor. Absolut zu empfehlen. Es gibt keine besten Plätze, ich würde aber empfehlen ganz vorne oben zu sitzen, dann könnt ihr die Tour auch noch als Sightseeing nutzen.

Comment: Fun for adults and children.
Book direct, in advance, is a must. Don't book via a 3rd party, or you may NOT get on the bus, as the numbers are not controlled totally by 3rd party sellers prior to the event. People were asked to leave, sadly.
We booked for october half term, and just fitted on, after arriving 20 minutes early.
Once the stress of getting on passed, we had a great time. It's more of an on-bus immersive experience, as it gets dark b4 the first bus leaves, this time of year. Enjoyed with my 12 year old. Laughed and jump-scared a lot.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Lots of laughs, yet also exciting. What an enthusiastic storyteller we had! Unfortunately, I don't remember his name, but thumbs up for the tour on October 20, 2023.
Also super fun for our 12-year-old son.

Tip: bring some cash for a tip. They're worth it.

(Original)
Veel gelachen en toch ook spannend. Wat een enthousiaste verhalenverteller hadden wij!! Jammer genoeg weet ik niet meer hoe hij heet, maar sowieso een duim omhoog voor de tour van 20/10/23.
Ook super leuk voor onze zoon van 12.

Tip, neem wat losgeld mee voor een fooi. Ze zijn het waard.

Comment: Such a fun ghost tour to do! We learned a lot about the creepy history behind Edinburgh and had a few good laughs along the way. Tommy was our tour guide and he was amazing! We loved walking through the graveyard, got some amazing pictures of the castle. Definitely worth doing when your visiting Edinburgh!

Comment: The ads on the side of the bus say it all: ghosts, theater, bad jokes. They delivered on all fronts! Staff clearly love what they do, the prices were great, and the optional excursion was fun. Learned some ghost stories to creep out our friends at dinner!
Note: If you're looking for tons of ghost stories with gory details, or even a slower paced look at the city, this may not satisfy your spooky hunger. But if you're looking for something hilarious while learning a few gruesome fun-facts - you're in the right spot!

Comment: Brilliant! The tour guide was so entertaining and informative a definite must do if you like ghosts and history.  I took a photo, on a quick stop, of the gate keeper’s lodge in the grave yard, it was used years ago by the keeper to keep grave diggers out, looks as if someone is looking through the window!

Comment: OMG, the last night in Ediburgh and I treated the family to the bus trip.  They did NOT DISAPPOINT.  You have to go.  Wish we went on it on day one as they showed us so many amazing places.  Walked in the cemetery.  The guide was absolutely hilarious.  You have to go on this bus.  Highlight of the vacation

Comment: Waste of time & money! The dark storytelling part was ok for those who are interested in such information, other than that it’s a complete waste of your money! Screens too small, acting was poor, no special effects whatsoever. Not funny at all and we all fell asleep after 15 min only.
Would not recommend at all

Comment: A lot of fun. Completely ridiculous but in a good way. If you have a wheelchair you need to buy a seat for it. We didn’t know but the staff was kind enough to watch it for us until the tour was over. Totally recommend.

Comment: If you want to study dark history of Edinburgh, this is the perfect bus tour for you. As the bus moves along the city road, narrator will tell you about the history of Edinburgh. I enjoyed the bus tour, but I feel they can do it little bit more tom make it interesting, for start the tv screen were too small, if you are in the middle seat of the upper deck you won’t get a good view of the screen. Secondly, the Indian conductor’s acting was fake & had poor narration skills, I felt he is not showing passion for history and just wanted to earn some money.

In other ways tour is fantastic I hope in your tour you have someone who is passionate about history or someone like Alice Loxton or someone who is the member of heritage committee.

I understand it’s a theatre company and run by a capitalist but being creative should not affect your capital in fact it will be opposite it will improve your capital as you will be showing genuine interest and appreciation for the history of Edinburgh. Ghost Tour will sell by itself. The world as enough capitalist, we need more creative thinkers. So get creative management company. Think outside of the box, you can do well.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Super funny bus tour! The guide clearly enjoyed his job! Very authentic and humorous.
Only the most haunted places in Edinburgh are visited. There are a few special effects and "scary" moments ???? that aren't necessarily suitable for very young children.
Applause!

Super witzige Bustour! Der Guide hat sichtlich Spaß an seinem Job! Sehr authentisch und witzig gemacht.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Wonderful! The staff was super attentive and kind, and it was a really fun tour. I love these macabre things and horror stories; the tour features spine-chilling legends and shows a super creepy side of Edinburgh. My mom and I loved it and had a great time. Congratulations to the team!

Maravilhoso! Equipe super atenciosa e gentil, um passeio bem divertido. Adoro essas coisas macabras e histórias de terror, o passeio conta com lendas de arrepiar a espinha e mostram um lado super assustador de edimburgo. Eu e minha mãe amamos e nos divertimos muito. Parabéns para a equipe!

Comment: Ghost Bus Tours was the best way to get a tour of the city! Tommy Terror was hilarious (just the sort of campy, absurd humor that we love) and actually got me with a couple of his gags. Way better than your usual hop on, hop off bus tours if you ask me!

A perfect mix of horror and comedy.
I would book it again!

Perfekte Mischung zwischen Grusel und Comedy.

Comment: My husband and I had the spookiest time on the Necrobus Tour in Edinburgh in April 2022. Tommy Terror, our tour guide, was incredibly knowledgeable about the haunted history of the city and kept us on the edge of our seats with his eerie stories.

But it wasn't just Tommy who made the tour amazing - our bus driver Angus was fantastic as well. He expertly navigated the narrow streets of Edinburgh, all while adding to the spooky ambiance with his own brand of humor and charm.

One of the highlights of the tour was definitely the visit to the Edinburgh Cemetery. Tommy led us through the gravestones, pointing out the most haunted spots and giving us a chilling insight into the ghosts who may still be lingering in the area.

The red velvet interior and the scary decor of the bus was the perfect touch, creating an atmospheric and creepy setting for the tour. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend the Ghost Necrobus Tour to anyone who loves a good scare!

Comment: (Translated by Google) A great tour through Edinburgh in an old bus with spooky decor. Many stories are told, and you stop at a cemetery. The guides are always enthusiastic and put in so much effort! I'd love to do it again, if you can laugh a bit and don't take everything too seriously :)

(Original)
Tolle Tour durch Edinburgh in einem alten Bus, der gruselig dekoriert ist. Viele Geschichten werden erzählt und man hält auf einem Friedhof an. Die Guides sind immer mit vollem Elan dabei und geben sich so viel Mühe! Gerne wieder, wenn man auch mal lachen kann und nicht alles zu ernst nimmt :)

Comment: (Translated by Google) So honestly, I don't understand the good reviews... I'm giving 1 star for the effort of the commentator who gives his person for the "crazy and wacky" atmosphere. Bravo to him. On the other hand, paying £20 per person for this attraction which is a walk at night through the city, which is in no way scary, which is boring and uncomfortable more than anything else.... it's really wasted time and money.... 50 min journey instead of 1h30 too.

(Original)
Alors sincèrement, je ne comprends pas les bons avis... je mets 1 étoile pour l'effort du commentateur qui donne sa personne pour l'ambiance "folle et loufoque". Bravo à lui. Par contre payer 20£ par personne pour cette attraction qui est une balade la nuit à travers la ville, qui ne fait en aucun cas peur, qui est ennuyante et malaisante plus qu'autre chose.... c'est du temps et de l'argent perdu vraiment.... 50min de trajet au lieu 1h30 aussi.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Very nice activity to do in Edinburgh!!! Quite fun, not that expensive and stop at a very nice cemetery!!! Negative point: we are not bilingual in English, so we only understood half. The atmosphere, on the other hand, tips the scales but too bad too :(

Comment: Really fun tour. Our guide really performed well, we loved his humor and accent. On a cold December night, it allowed us to see some of the city without walking around or waiting on a city bus. The old bus was very rickety and exciting to ride in. Don't miss this!

Comment: 27/11/2022 took the Edinburgh Ghost bus tour and have to say the first 10 mins were highly amusing with our tour guide Samuel. The bus was clean, warm and comfortable. However after the first 10 mins of Samuel trying to make everyone jump! He quickly became extremely annoying! This tour is NOT to take in historical sights it’s more of a “comedy”  trip which personally left me feeling disappointed.
There were 4 of us and at £19pp I felt this didn’t justify the experience. Choose another tour if you want a more informative experience.

Comment: Honestly worst touristic experience I’ve ever been on. I will give one star because our tour guide, Spooky Sam, was so dedicated to the role - and I have to appreciate that. There was no historical content and little comedy. My two young cousins (11 and 13) asked to get off in the first 10 min. Don’t waste your money.

Comment: I went on a 10:30pm tour on Halloween weekend. I expected to learn about creepy and sinister goings on in Edinburgh throughout history. However, most of the content was made up ghost stories. It felt very targeted towards children, despite the fact that no children would be out at this time!

The tour was super cringe and made worse by the fact that other people on the tour sat in our seats halfway through so my group was split up.

The tour could be improved greatly by getting rid of the fake ghost story on the bus. Maybe have a tour for children in the day and then make it more adult oriented at night when there are no children about.

Comment: The tour itself shows you around the slightly more grimm side of the city, the stories that are shared are good, but sometimes they'd rush by them quickly, I often found myself wanting to know more about certain myths or stories, but they weren't elaborated on much. The host is great, the storytelling is humourous, and the walking part of the tour is really worth it! It really shows the storytelling skills of the host! Thanks for the frights, Davy.

Comment: Ok, go in knowing this is going to be a bit of jokey schlocky fun and you'll have a blast.  The conductor was excellent, playing up his bit and made us laugh many times.  He did well splitting his time between the upper deck and lower deck.  We got a bit of fun haunted history as part of it and you get to see Edinburgh at night.  Our teenager had a lot of fun with it and it was a highlight of his trip.

Comment: Super fun experience! Great way too seethe city and get little tid bits of information.  Our conductor did a great job of entertaining us. There is one part where you can get off the bus and walk for a few minutes. Aside from that you will be on the bus. Would definitely reccomend this tour!

Comment: It was a lovely tour. Sitting in the bus was among the best experiences cos of the atmosphere and the lamps. Devious Dave was quite funny too . Only issue is I feel that there s a lot of scope for more stories to be developed. Felt like the content was lacking a bit and the tour could have gone deeper into the history of Edinburgh.

Comment: (Translated by Google) A tourist attraction, but still fun. The tour lasts about an hour and is presented by a guy straight out of a mental institution (or the best drama school in Edinburgh...).
Be careful, however, if you don't speak English or have limited comprehension; it can be difficult to follow everything due to the per-minute speech rate and the strong accent of the tour leader, which is obviously welcome. For everyone else, don't hesitate; you'll learn more about paranormal folklore and Edinburgh's darker history, and have a great time in a great atmosphere.

PS: I recommend going at 7:30 or 9:00 PM to really immerse yourself in the atmosphere!

(Original)
Attraction pour les touristes mais cela n'en reste pas moins rigolo. La visite dure environs une heure et est présentée par un type tout droit sorti d'un asile psychiatrique (ou bien de la meilleure école de théâtre d'Edimbourg...).
Attention néanmoins aux personnes ne parlant pas Anglais ou avec une compréhension limitée, cela peut être compliqué de tout suivre de par le débit de paroles à la minute et au fort accent du maître de la visite, bien évidemment souhaité. Pour les autres, n'hésitez pas, vous en apprendrez plus sur le folklore paranormal, et l'histoire plus sombre d'Edimbourg et passerez un super moment dans une super ambiance.

PS : Je vous conseillerai d'y aller à l'horaire 19.30 ou 21.00 pour être d'avantage dans l'atmosphère !

Comment: (Translated by Google) A fantastic and fun ghost tour through the center of Edinburgh. It's more of a comedy show than a scary experience. If you're looking for a scare, you won't find it here.
The design, decor, and technology make it a very complete experience.
They even took us off the bus for 10 minutes to explore a cemetery at night!
I definitely recommend it.

(Original)
Un fantástico y divertido tour fantasma por el centro de Edimburgo. Es más una obra de teatro de comedia que algo de miedo. Si buscas pasar miedo aquí no lo vas a encontrar.
Tanto el diseño como la decoración y la tecnología hacen que sea una experiencia muy completa.
Hasta nos bajaron del bus por 10 minutos para recorrer un cementerio por la noche!!
Yo lo recomiendo sin duda.

Comment: So much better than I thought it would be. Plenty of jump scares and laugh-out-loud moments. Best to do at night, especially around Halloween season. The Tour Host was fab and really got into character. Only problem was I wished it lasted a little longer but I had a great time.

Comment: Tour was a blast! Ghost stories, fog, funny jokes, and my sister was freaked out and terrified. It made the tour even better. Sorry, sis. We stopped in a haunted graveyard and had time to take pics. Think the Disney Jungle Cruise, only a terrifying version. I'll be sure to recommend to friends.

Comment: (Translated by Google) A very fun tour. The guide was very convincing and very funny.

It has little to do with a "real ghost tour," more of an informative, fun tour with a certain creepy factor.

I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind going to the basement for a laugh :)

(Original)
Sehr lustige Tour. Der Guide war sehr überzeugend und sehr lustig.
Hat wenig mit einer "echten Geistertour" zu tun, eher eine Informative, lustige Tour mit dem gewissen Gruselfaktor.

Würde ich jedem empfehlen der fürs Lachen nicht in den Keller geht :)

Comment: (Translated by Google) This little bus tour went very well, the actor is very talented and told the various horror stories that happened in Edinburgh well. The only small problem is that if you are a foreigner it can be difficult to hear and understand what he is saying, especially with the noise of the old bus engine!

(Original)
Cette petite tournée en bus s’est très bien déroulé, l’acteur est très doué et racontait bien les diverses histoires d’horreur s’étant passé à Édimbourg. Le seul petit hic, c’est que si vous êtes étranger ça peut être compliqué de bien entendre et comprendre ce qu’il raconte surtout avec le bruit du moteur du vieux bus!

Comment: (Translated by Google) I can't say anything negative either.
It was a great, exciting and educational experience in Edinburgh. We didn't see as many things in Edinburgh as on other tours, but it was definitely the most adventurous and should be remembered by our little one (3 years old) for a long time. There was even a visit to the cemetery with great ghost stories, which meant that almost everyone took part.
Our guide Tom did this with a lot of dedication and didn't seem silly in any way but rather authentic (he only had to laugh once ;))
I can only warmly recommend the tour to get to know other stops and stories about Edinburgh. A little tip: if possible, do it with children and in the dark ;)

(Original)
Ich kann auch nichts negatives sagen.
War ein tolles, spannendes und lehrreiches Erlebnis in Edinburgh. Wir haben zwar nicht so viele Sachen von Edinburgh gesehen wie bei anderen Touren, aber definitiv war sie die abenteuerreichste und sollte auch bei unserem kleinen (3 Jahre) noch lange in Erinnerung bleiben. Sogar einen Besuch auf dem Friedhof gab es mit tollen Geistergeschichten, wodurch auch fast alle mitgemacht haben.
Unser Führer Tom hat das auch mit sehr viel Hingabe gemacht und wirkte in keinster Weise albern sondern authentisch (nur einmal musste auch er lachen ;) )
Ich kann die Tour nur wärmstens empfehlen um auch mal andere Stationen und Geschichten zu Edinburgh kennenzulernen. Kleiner Tipp: wenn möglich mit Kindern machen und im Dunkeln ;)

Comment: Really cool tour of the city with a good stage presence. I believe it is cheaper to book in person than online there is a booth to do so near the pick up location.

Comment: Bus stop was closed for an event, they didn’t give us a new location to meet at and did not respond when we tried to reach out for help until we had missed the tour time. Will not give us a refund.

Comment: I want to preface this with a warning that if you are looking for scary, this isn’t the right thing for you. However, it was still very entertaining and our conductor Hector (?) was hilarious! Was very fun seeing the city and hearing some ghost stories. Would highly recommend if you’re in the area!

Great tour
Try and avoid the Japanese tourists, they are the worst everywhere except on their own dirt sack island.

Comment: We thoroughly enjoyed our time on the ghost bus while in Edinburgh. The tour was well planned, engaging and fun. A little on the expensive side but given the current climb in petrol etc I'm sure it's needed especially with maintenance on the old bus plus staff wages.

The only thing that could have improved it is the natural light not being so bringt but we are further north and thus it stays lighter darker and that is out of the remit of the ghost bus team.

Thank you for a fun evening.

Comment: The best thing about the tour was seeing parts of Edinburgh we hadn’t explored yet. It was extremely cheesy and gimmicky. I would have preferred more real stories of the history of Edinburgh. The seating was very cramped with two people on one bench. Overall the tour was just alright.

Comment: 10/10 never have I ever done a ghost tour, this bus creates a real private spooky atmosphere with the darkness, sounds and effects which could otherwise be lost in walking tour weaving in a crowded walking street with other shoppers looking over to try see what's going on.

Comment: Save your money!! There are far more entertaining and informative ghost tours in Edinburgh. Once you get past the unique selling point of the bus, this is the most underwhelming tour we have ever taken. Very few stories or history were shared, the main thrust of the tour is a ludicrous made up story that then moves to a seance, not funny or interesting in any way. My advice would be to save your cash, take a pic of the bus instead and do one of the numerous superior walking ghost tours that Edinburgh has to offer

Comment: Oh, deary me, such high expectations and quite a disappointing result. I do understand that it is a horror comedy, but why should it be low quality. The first 15 minutes I was sort of interested, but everything after the visit to the cemetery was just boooring. Definitely not worth the money, and felt a little cheated. The guide Spooky tried to do his best, but it didn't help to save the show. Even kids fell asleep! The best part of the tour is the bus. So do not expect much, or blame yourself for not reading this review.

Comment: Oliver our bus conductor made this a very enjoyable experience. Fun and a teeny bit scary makes this a family friendly activity. Tourists to Edinburgh will appreciate learning a bit about some of Edinburghs grisly past. If you want to be scared silly this is not the trip for you and I'm not sure how much locals will get much out of it. Can't praise Oliver highly enough, perfect 'casting'.

Managed to get a groupon which meant I got 3 tickets for around half price.
The bus has a really good atmosphere, the stories are spooky yet funny, and the tour guide makes the journey fun and hilarious.

I would definitely recommend and I’d love to do it again.

Comment: Amazing trip. I went with my husband and my 9 year old son and we all really enjoyed it. You learn lots of interesting history and tales of the paranormal.
Definitely worth the money.

It's an hour of terror and comedy, with a small tour of Edinburgh cemetery too.
Loved it..

Comment: Been on many ghost tours but this one was by far the best! Devious Davey was quite the host with jokes, play on words and total theatrics! But very informative too. We'd been to a ghost tour the night before and didn't take much from it

Comment: Fantastic way to spend an hour, with the fantastically funny guide devious dave and driver Angus. Hear about the ghosts that abound edinburgh.
A smoke effect at the end of the tour can be little uncomfortable if you have breathing issues, but its over quick enough.
Highly recommended.

Comment: Bit disappointed that we were unable to select seating. The website said to get there early and we would get first selection. Unfortunately we were seated in the lower level despite being the second people there. Few incorrect facts stated during the talk also. But overall entertaining.

Comment: Devious Daviey was our conductor for the evening. He was fab! Definitely kept us all entertained. We also stopped for a small walk through Edinburghs oldest graveyard where we were told some stories - of course made hilarious by our bus conductor.
Definitely recommend for an hour of fun and some interesting ghostly stories!

Comment: 15 minutes late starting. All left standing outside the bus in the rain.. So a bus full of wet  cold people meant it was steamed up and you couldn't see through the windows.... Technical probs with  screens /effects on board..  Broken..
Poor guide tried his best to make it interesting.. It was awful! Worst part of our otherwise great stay in  Edinburgh!

Comment: The tour guide and driver were fantastic but they had a shockingly poor script to work with. It's not their fault in the slightest, that's on the company. Tommy and Angus turned weak material into a fun evening. It needs ghosts from Edinburgh crime (like Burke and Hare or stories about graveyards) and less "ooh look out this window for the wee ghostie...and look out that one for another one...".

I know it's a ghost tour but the choice of ghosts wasn't great. The whole thing leaned too hard on the bus as ghostly (as opposed to the city) too.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Excellent Ghost Bus Tour that tells you about the dark history of Edinburgh through hidden neighborhoods of the city. It combines the creepy with comedy, I would say, successfully. Recommended for horror movie lovers.

Comment: Would 100% recommend this tour full of interesting stories from parts of Edinburgh,plenty of humour for both adults and kids the tour guide we had this evening was spooky Samuel and he was absolutely brilliant. The walk in the graveyard paired with Samuel and the story he told was worth the cold feet.

Comment: Having done a foot tour of Edinburgh and got very cold, this really appealed.  We took our two children 11 and 8, who got into the spirit of things, however our 8 yr old is quite squeamish and had to be reassured by his older sister.  The guide was great - and the tour fun and interesting, very happy we booked this.  As for the company, I had deleted the booking email!  So messaged them to get a replacement confirmation and I had this back within an hour of the company opening!

Comment: Bit different from the usual ghost walking tours.Its really funny in a warped humour which I liked. Probably could have been longer at the spooky areas.Actually worked out cheaper than a walking tour for a family of four. Lasted just over an hour.

Comment: We had a tour scheduled for 7:30. Our dinner ran a little late but we managed to run and make it to the pick up spot at 7:29 on the dot. The bus was still there and they refused to let us on. They did let us get on the next tour at 9 pm but that was too late for half our group. The other half of us did do the later one. To make matters worse. People were still being let on the bus for the second tour at 9:05. As for the actual tour, seats are TINY, if there’s two adults you will be squished and uncomfortable the entire time. I’ve done other walking ghost tours in Edinburgh, the staff and guides were much more helpful and friendly.

Comment: We booked a private tour on the ghost bus for my hen do and it was genuinely brilliant. The tour itself covers a lot of creepy Edinburgh history, while also being really funny and a bit camp. Spooky Samuel really made the tour, staying in character the whole time. Also unintentionally charming some of the bridal party who likely would have brought him along for the rest of our night out if they could have ????. Booking for a private tour was so easy and the team were really responsive. Really helped to make my day spooky and fun - would definitely book again!

Comment: It was a good laugh and the bus is cool!

We are an adult couple and I would say you could take kids aged 10 or over. It's quite expensive but it's a capital city so you will pay that for tours - we think it's still worth it.

We had Davey as the tour guide. He was really funny - it's kind of like a comedy/theatre tour on wheels. You get off to walk through a graveyard too which is cool. We enjoyed the tour and would recommend it. Davey told us some cool ghost stories too.

One improvement: I would like if the tour guides gave us a bit more idea of dates and eras of the ghost stories. Eg. One was from the 1960s but I think one was from the 1700s but we didn't get a clear idea of the eras. So it would be cool if the era was included in the story.

Comment: At first the guide sets the stage seems spooky but its funny and you will enjoy the whole trip. You will get knowledge about all the ghost and haunted stories of and around old town of Edinburgh. The Guide was exceptional, and this comedy with Jenny's favourite seat was fantastic. I would say its a joyful evening trip for those who want to spend time around the city with funny comentary and ghost storied.

Comment: Funny and silly. A two star because the man screams into the mic at random times. Clearly doesn’t care about hearing conservation. Was way too loud and rode the tour with my kids and I covering our ears the whole time. Pretty painful to ride if you have hearing issues.

Comment: First off I want to say we really enjoyed our tour and it’s a great way to see Edinburgh! But unfortunately this is the second review I’ve had to write about what must be an ongoing issue with their phones.
I had called multiple times and waited for what amounted to be hours to arrange a tour with a Groupon that I bought. After getting nowhere, I wrote a review saying that there was a communication issue that was really frustrating for me as a customer. I almost immediately got a call from the tour company and they got me on the tour I had been calling to get on. I then removed my review.
Fast forward and I just got my phone bill from last month in. I was really confused about why I had more money taken out than usual and I see that it’s because I had called the Ghost Bust Tour number that is listed on Google and the company website (it used to be listed on Groupon but they seem to have taken it down after I told them it wasn’t correct because I never got through to anyone. The phone number listed has a spooky voice actor answer and asks you which city you’d like to go on a ghost bus tour in and it does a whole bit about how you’re on hold because they are moving a body and all this themed stuff (which is actually funny and cute). But now I’m stuck with a phone bill for a number that doesn’t even work even though it’s listed everywhere and the answering machine identifies the number as the right number. There is no mention of the fact that there will be a charge for calling this number anywhere on the recording.
After the issues I had with the number before, this is the cherry on top. Again, the tour was great but they really need to work on this.

Comment: Myself and my partner (both 23) went on this tour and we both had a fabulous time. If you're looking for something very serious and scary, this maybe isn't it but the stories were fascinating, the laughs were plenty and the views were great. Big shout out to our creepy conductor Dave who did a wonderful job of toeing the line between spooky and funny. Would recommend this tour to anyone who wanted to see the sights of Edinburgh in an unorthodox way! The section walking through the graveyard was excellent and very atmospheric.

Comment: Great and fun experience. We went to the tour with two kids which enjoyed (got bit scared) the show. Oliver Sutton the host was hilarious and made it such an enjoyable time. We stopped on the cemetery and got very great and commentary. We will recommend it anytime.

Comment: Really good. The guide read very entertaining and the tour was better than I expected.
I'd have liked a bit more detail of infamous murders but over all it was very good. Highly recommended.

Comment: Three of us were booked to take the Ghost Tour at 9pm on Sunday and despite being the only ones on that particular tour and the bus having just finished a sold-out tour, Oliver (and 'Angus') did a blinding tour full of energy and we never felt at any point that we weren't getting the full experience! As well as hearing the ghostly tales, we were treated to a lot of fascinating facts about Edinburgh that has certainly peaked my interest for another visit!

It was the perfect blend of theatrics, spooky stories and background to Edinburgh - all on a very funky Routemaster bus! Cheers, it was great entertainment! Would recommend :)

Comment: Had a great time with Hector as our guide through the spooky stories of Edinburgh, he played a great character and was quite informative, maybe not as gory as the little one would have liked but great fun. Unfortunately the weather was very wet which put a damper on the walking tour of the cemetery but what can be expected from Edinburgh in February.

Comment: The tour was excellent, the guide had a great balance of comedy and spooky stories. It is also really interesting to learn about other sides of Edinburgh history. There is a 10min walk in the middle of the tour through a cemetery, you can also stay in the bus where you get the same stories told.

Comment: Our tour guide was Cameron Cunning and he was so much fun, kept everyone on the bus laughing the whole time and you can tell he takes pride in what he does and throws himself wholeheartedly into the role. Not super spooky, so still fun for the whole family. It was a fun way to see a little more of the city and spend an extra hour we had in an entertaining way. Definitely recommend even if you’re not normally into ghost type activities.

Comment: Had a great experience. Eddie Volvo (made up name) was a hilarious conductor. He turned my bf into an Italian and named him Enrico. I was chuffed. Thanks Eddie! Highly recommended ????

Comment: Great fun. Very camp. Don't take it too seriously but a good way to have a look around the city at night and learn about the dark underbelly of the old city.

Comment: A really fun tour, we've done the one in York too. Our guide in Edinburgh was 'Tommy Terror' and he presented a lot of local knowledge mixed with comedy and it was very entertaining. These tours are child friendly as they give a light-hearted view of the dark history of cities.

Comment: (Translated by Google) An attraction designed more for children, it features ghost stories from the city, with a tour of the legendary locations at night and actors on the bus acting out the stories. Fun

(Original)
Atracción pensada más para los niños, son historias de fantasmas de la ciudad, con un recorrido por los lugares de las leyendas por la noche y actores en el autobús representando las mismas. Divertido

Comment: Edinburgh ghost tour bus is 100% worth it! I was iffy on going today just because it said comedy on their facebook page. hmmm , I thought it was going to be so not funny and cheesy. Let me tell you I was so wrong. The tour guide totally got into character, was so funny and fun! The history was there and was well described and toured but in a funny, and way fun way!  The bus itself is super cool and for sure decorated to theme! I could not stop smiling! Check groupon for a discount! Just a tip! Anyway so worth it, I can’t stop smiling just thinking about it!

Comment: (Translated by Google) We booked the bus tour 15 days ago. The audio system broke halfway through, and they canceled the tour. We were never able to finish it. They never refunded us the money they promised. Be very careful with this company.

(Original)
Hace 15 días  contratamos el tour en el bus , a mitad del tour se rompió el audio y suspendieron el tour nunca pudimos terminarlo . Nunca nos devolvieron el dinero que prometieron devolvernos. Mucho cuidado con esta empresa

Comment: To be honest, this tour was disappointing! It was neither scary, nor informative. In my oppinion, it was not even very funny. The actor just tells you which attraction the bus is passing right now without giving any details except for made-up stories why which place is haunted. All together the whole tour seemed to me like a cheap way to grab the tourists' money without investing too much. Sorry, but I would never again pay 17 pounds for that!

Comment: (Translated by Google) A truly unique experience on the streets of Edinburgh. With an Italian guide, we took a tour through the streets of Edinburgh's historic center, past the closers and ancient Gothic buildings. The tour was also enriched by the fascinating stories of ghosts and witches that are part of the city's history. A truly excellent tour, well-organized and managed, and one I would definitely do again.

Un'esperienza davvero unica nelle strade di Edimburgo. Con una guida italiana abbiamo effettuato un percorso lungo le strade del centro storico di Edimburgo, tra i closer e gli antichi palazzi in stile gotico. Un percorso arricchito anche dalle affascinanti storie di fantasmi e di streghe che fanno parte della storia della città. Davvero un ottimo tour, ben organizzato e gestito che rifarei nuovamente

Comment: (Translated by Google) Saw the cool bus and as they were about to leave we decided to go along. The tour is a comedy show with a ghost theme so the history of Edinburgh comes through through the narration of a number of ghosts and haunted places. The guide did a good job of entertaining and the whole set up felt fun (and a bit informative).

(Original)
Såg den coola bussen och då de snart skulle åka bestämde vi oss för att följa med. Guidningen är en komediföreställning med spöktema så Edinburghs historia kommer fram genom berättandet om ett antal spöken och hemsökta platser.
Guiden gjorde ett bra jobb i att underhålla och hela upplägget kändes roligt (och lite informativt).

Comment: An unexpectedly intense and fun bus ride with a bunch of quick stories of the town's past presented by a very enthusiastic guide and with some nice special effects. Sure it's cheesy, but fun-cheesy. Laughed a lot. Highly recommended.

Comment: Brilliant! My 8 year old granddaughter and I loved the tour. Such friendly helpful drivers, so very nice to my granddaughter, she loved the upstairs front seat and history. We used the hop on /off to access Dynamic Earth,  Grey Friars Bobby,  Camera Obscura etc. A fantastic way to get to all attractions without having to drag a child round the city. Highly recommend the tour bus.
Looking at other reviews regarding not enough time to visit attractions and have lunch etc, remember that your ticket is valid for 24 hours, we used it 2 days.

Comment: (Translated by Google) The bus tours are ideal for exploring the city. Some of the live guides are very informative. One tour also offers the opportunity to hear Edinburgh's ghost stories.

(Original)
Die Bus-Touren sind optimal um die Stadt zu erkunden. Die teilweise vorhandenen Live-Guides sind sehr informativ. Zusätzlich kann man bei einer Linie die Geistergeschichten von Edinburgh hören.

Comment: (Translated by Google) Perfect if you want to explore the city in a week without stressing out with long walks.
For £20 per person, you can get them for 48 hours, allowing you to take three routes and explore Edinburgh in complete comfort.
I recommend them.

(Original)
Perfetti se volete girare la città in un Week senza stressarvi con lunghe camminate.
Con 20£ p.p li prendete per 48ore e puoi fare 3 rotte e guardare Edimburgo in tutta comodità.
Io le consiglio.

Comment: Though Edinburgh is a very small town and most of the tourist attraction are around the royal mile , but still it is worth while to take hop and hop , take a trou , get acquainted with the city , know brief geography , history and see places.

Comment: If you are in Edinburgh for the first time, consider this tour before you do anything, accordingly you can plan where you want to visit and enjoy rest of your days, such a nice & friendly Bus drivers and ready to help as well. The tour takes around 90 minuets with hop on hop off service, your ticket is valid for 24 hours. We paid £51 for 3 Adults & 2 children.

Comment: This tour company offers four different tours with different colors and routes but limited information for each tour. I waited for twenty minutes for the City Sightseeing tour before I asked a green bus if it was ever coming and was directed avross the street.

Comment: The Edinburgh Bus Tour is a fantastic way to view through all of Edinburgh's natural beauty! The view from outside the bus is spectacular, combined with the sunny weather and breezing air. The tour guides I have encountered were also friendly and they told a lot of history of these landmarks, not to mention the landmarks I visited are also spectacular and out of this world!

Comment: We only had a few hours in Edinburgh and this bus tour helped orient us. We enjoyed the humorous commentary of Kerr (april 4). He also directed us down hidden walking paths to find a statue of John Knox that was on our list of things to find. It was a snowy, blustery day and we wished we had time to do more. We appreciated that we had the bus to give us shelter, fun and information. We met Kerr again at Stop 1 and he even directed us how to get a city bus back to Colinton. We hope to get back someday for longer use of the hop on/hop off activities.

We saw a lot of the places we had been and learned a bit of fun facts. And discovered some new. Green bus has live tour guide. Don't miss it. Do it early in your stay to help you acclaimate.

Comment: The Edinburgh Tour was most entertaining! Not only you can learn fun facts, but also the guide, Rob,  in our case, is really good-humoured. 5£ more and you can take that bus all day long as you continue to visit each of the attractions nearby bus stops. Very efficient and comfortable way of sight-seeing especially considering scottish weather ;)

Comment: (Translated by Google) I'm a regular at city sightseeers around the world... I use it every time I arrive in a city to explore it beforehand, get the inside scoop on the sites, and then plan ahead, maximizing my satisfaction. It's also an ideal and economical means of transportation... It's as direct as a taxi and costs infinitely less.
Edinburgh is by far the best. New buses, with wooden floors, a digital audio and video system (even two monitors in the accessible/stroller spaces with exterior cameras and subtitles so they or the rest of the bus can see all the monuments), heating, and a charming and helpful staff (except for one clueless driver we had). Cullen (or Calum, I'm still struggling with the Scottish accent :P) was on the green tour, and he was superior, super friendly, and an excellent professional.
In addition to the traditional red tour, there are several others, each with a unique incentive, and you can buy them all, even with paid monument tickets, at an exceptional price.
I recommend it 100%.

Soy un asiduo de los citysightseeing del mundo... Lo uso siempre que llego a una ciudad para conocerla antes, conocer los detalles de los sitios y así luego planificar a tiro hecho y maximizando la satisfacción. También como medio de transporte ideal y económico... Es directo como un taxi y vale infinitamente menos.
Edinburgh es el mejor con diferencia. Autobuses nuevos, con suelo estilo madera, con sistema de audio y vídeo digital (incluso dos monitores en los sitios de minusvalidos/carritos con cámaras exteriores y subtítulos para que ellos o el resto del bus pueda ver todos los monumentos), calefacción, personal encantador y servicial (excepto un conductor pillado que nos tocó). Cullen (o Calum aún tengo dificultades con el acento escocés :P) nos tocó en el tour verde y fue superior, supersivertido y excelente profesional.
Además de tradicional tour rojo hay varios más cada uno con un aliciente y puedes comprarlos todos incluso con entradas a los monumentos de pago a un precio excepcional.
Lo recomiendo 100%

Comment: Little pricey and the last bus leaves at 4 so if you get there at 9 for first bus and figure 2 hours of Edinburgh castle at least and add time for lunch you really only have time for one more stop.

Comment: We had used the sight seeing bus in another city and got a discount on the tickets for this one.

It is a good way to find out the history of Edinburgh and it is good that you get earphones to plug in and keep.

It is amazing of what you don't know about your city until you sit on one of these buses and listen to the history.

It is good that you can hop on and hop off at different locations if you wish to see different things like Holyrood Palace or Dynamic Earth.

Comment: Pamela L (0 review)

I had purchased tickets for Edinburgh bus tours online in anticipation of a day trip into Edinburgh. I was able to upgrade my ticket to a grand 24 ticket for an additional £5 which enabled me to hop on and off the three different tours for as often as I liked within a 24 hour period. It was easy to exchange my online voucher for tickets when I was ready to use them and the tickets are definitely value for money. The tours are informative and allow you to see more of Edinburgh than you would otherwise do on foot. Your ticket also entitles you to discounts for many of the attractions within Edinburgh which is an added bonus.  I would definitely go on the tours again and would not hesitate to recommend them.  One final point to note is that the buses are pet friendly and we were able to take our two dogs on the tour without any problems.

Comment: Waste of time.  Directions on the site and by staff members were confusing and ridiculously misleading. We followed the directions off the website and could not locate the bus.  After running around in circles after 15 minutes we finally found the bus 2 minutes past the start time whilst the bus is still at the starting point.  However the did not sympathise for our situation and refused entry onto the bus even though it hasn't moved.

Comment: Bit of a waste of time really. Not that funny and definitely not worth the money. We paid in Tesco vouchers and still think we wasted them. If you paid the asking price in cash I don't think that you would be getting value for money. I have done several walking tours in Edinburgh before from different suppliers and they have all been very good, informative and well worth the money.

Comment: Offers a pretty good 1-hour tour of the main sites, but it's best if you use it as public transit when touring the city, as you can get on and off at all the main places.

Comment: Bud tours are quintessentially touristy but when you're in a town for a short (at least 2/3 days) time, I think they're the first thing you should do. They give you perspective and a macroscopic picture of the town's geography. This better equips one with both knowledge and confidence to plan the rest of their trip around. However, if you're somewhere for too little time, don't try to get the bigger picture - just enjoy!

Comment: Best to use these tours at the start of your trip, as they'll show you places you might not have visited. Good value if you plan to use the hop on hop off over 24 hours.

Comment: It's the best way to get around town and familiarize yourself with the hot spots. The ride is short because the town is small but it makes everything more accessible.

Comment: Great way to see Edinburgh at a more reasonable price then public transit. Also make sure you that if you are planning on visiting major attractions, buy the tickets from the tour company. They are the same or cheaper as regular fares but are fast track tickets and allow you to skip all the lines. A lot of the tour guides are old and slow and are very boring. If this happens to you make sure you change and wait for the next bus (15 mins) as they can make for a very unpleasant trip. The good tour guides will make sure you enjoy your trip and share all their local secrets and give you a good heads up on the local dives.

Comment: The cheese factor is high, but the guide, Tommy, is funny and personable and tells good tales. For a reasonable price, you get a tour of central Edinburgh along with a bit of an education on the grislier portions of Edinburgh's history.

Comment: Take the LIVE guide tour and you will enjoy the tour. Not that the recorded tour is bad but Live guide is much better. The guide had a very good knowledge about the history of the city. Tickets are valid for 24 hrs. Recommended tour if first time visiting the city.

Comment: A ghost tour that's more comedy than scares but it's hard not to get wrapped up in the flourish of the performance.
You're going to learn a little bit about Edinburgh but this is really a bit of theatre. Loved it all.

Comment: Good experience. Pick ups every 20-25 minutes. Loved the open air busses even though it was chilly and cloudy out. I recommend taking the entire tour and then picking what stops you want to get off on. The stops hit the majority of the places I wanted to visit today. Just remember to grab your earbuds to listen to the guided tour. It is available in 8 languages plus 1 channel with the darker side of the city. It was alot of fun.
